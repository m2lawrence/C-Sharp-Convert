# C-Sharp-Convert
Converting to a data type.

If an exception is not thrown, a message is displayed based on whether the age is less than 21.

This sets up the foundation for you to be able to get information from the end user, convert it to a more usable format, and verify the information to make sure it is valid.

In today’s lesson, you learned how to format information to make it more presentable. In addition to learning how to format regular data types, you learned how to get and format dates and times.

The second half of today’s lesson focused more on working with strings and the methods available to use with them. Because strings are immutable—they can’t be changed—you also learned about the StringBuilder class. Using this class, you learned how to manipulate string information.

Today ended by focusing on obtaining information from the console. You revisited the Read and ReadLine methods. To these you combined what you learned with formatting strings and with a new conversion class. You now know how to retrieve information from
the console and format it into a usable format, which can include different data types.
